    👋 Hi, I’m @His-Nobles
    👀 I’m passionate about web development, programming with JavaScript, Java, and Python, and I'm intrigued by flying devices, drones, and the vast world of aviation.
    🌱 I’m currently studying Applied Computer Science at Chuka University in Kenya.
    💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on programming challenges and problem-solving projects.

    ⚡ Fun Fact: My first girlfriend once said I made her feel like she was levitating—and these days, I feel the same when I listen to powerful worship songs. It’s an incredible feeling.
