    ⚡ Fun Fact: I noticed that my eyes get wider whenever i open any of this three apps on my computer; {"VS Code", "Intellij", "Pycharm"} so anytime i get drowsy, i simply open one of them, and i tell you the experience is algorithmically fantastic😂😂its takes sleep away, 😂i dont use no sleeping pills😂 
    🎀My first girlfriend once toold me that i make her experience levitations, that feeling of being as light as a feather, or purhaps floating in the air, "Nice vibe right?"😂this days I feel the same when I listen to powerful worship songs. It’s an incredible feeling.🦅🐤🎗
